# NWC Summer Institute Docker / Jupyter Training
This is a fork

This repository holds a Dockerfile for a Jupyter installation and dependencies for use in training at the 2019 National Water Center Summer Institute.

Assuming you've installed [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [git](https://git-scm.com/)/[gitbash (windows)](https://gitforwindows.org/), to get started, open a terminal or gitbash and do:

```
git clone https://github.com/dblodgett-usgs/si_docker_jupyter_training.git
cd si_docker_jupyter_training
docker-compose up
```

To run the Docker image, from the root of this repository, do:

`docker-compose up`

Or to build the container from scratch, modify docker-compose.yml to `build: .` rather than start from a declared image and do:

`docker-compose up --build`

## Activity
**Task 0:** All take part (pair program as needed)  
Summary: Chose teams of 2 and get jupyter working on both of your machines. http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree should show the "work" folder and you should see this repository's contents in "work".  
Resource: Google and/or other people.  
Outcome: Jupyter running on local machines ready for further tasks.  

**Task 1:** Younger team member leads.  
Summary: Use R to get some streamflow data, precipitation data, and some basic geospatial data for a small watershed. This demonstration will include some plotting to verify we got the data.  
Resource: get\_hydro\_data.ipynb
Outcome: Modified (rerun) get\_hydro\_data.ipynb. Data files for later use will be saved locally but not checked in.

**Task 2:** Younger team member leads.  
Summary: Check the modified notebook into a personal github repository. You will need to initialize a repository, create a new github remote, create a `.gitignore` and `README.md`, commit your files, and push them to your remote repository.
Resource: Google and/or other people.  
Outcome: An updated version of the notebook checked into one participant's personal repository.  

**Task 3:** Older team member leads.  
Summary: Clone partner's work in github, pull to local, and use Python to implement an idealized model. Either route streamflow or produce runoff using a simple algorithm that can be coded quickly. Should include some plotting to verify inputs and outputs.
Resource: ...
Outcome: A notebook that implements a simple idealized simulation relying on some of the data we found in task 1.

**Task 4:** Older team member leads.  
Summary: Commit work and push work into personal remote fork and open pull request to partner. Make sure you've talked about data-handling and `.gitignore` conventions make sense for your shared work.
Resource: Google and/or other people.
Outcome: Merged pull request from older team member to younger team member's repository.

**Task 5:** Both team mates complete together (pair program).
Summary: Fork and pull down some other team's work, make sure you can reproduce everything, and build a post-process visualization (both spatial and temporal) that shows what the other team did in R or Python. 
Resource: Google and/or other people.
Outcome: Pull request to other team with any changes needed to get things to work and post-process visualization.

**Task 6:** Group activity.
Summary: In this activity, the teams will start together and discuss how things went. Discussion questions will be provided. We will then get together as a whole group and summarize each team's experience to everyone.
Resource: None
Outcome: Perspective on the process of collaborative development.
